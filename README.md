# README

The code that generates the submission for this visualization, which pictures
the loss of global forest cover from the year 1992 to 2015.

The repo consists of a Jupyter notebook, which parses the data from 
https://github.com/littlepictures/datasets/tree/main, and a Vite project which
generates the static site which has the visualization.
